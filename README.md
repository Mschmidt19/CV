# Marek W Schmidt
I am a full-stack software engineer with an extensive background in graphic design. Always up for new challenges, I am often described as a quick learning, detail-oriented, and cooperative worker who is flexible in many work environments and atmospheres. I am currently in the last month of a 16-week course at Maker's Academy, London, rapidly increasing my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, SRP, and XP values.

## Projects
| *Title* | *Description* | *Time-frame* | *Technologies Used* |  
| :-----: | :-----------: | :----------: | :-----------------: |  
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Mschmidt19/acebook-Team-and-a-half), [Live link](https://murmuring-earth-81334.herokuapp.com/) | The second group project while attending Maker's, we were tasked with building a Facebook clone using Ruby on Rails, a framework that nobody in the group had used previously. With an emphasis on teamwork and imitating a continuous deployment environment, we had many challenges to overcome. | Two weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Travis CI, Rspec, and Capybara |  
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/Mschmidt19/Makersbnb) | Having now seen five weeks of on-site training and the introduction of our second language (Javascript), it was time to put our learning at Makers to the test. A group of five were tasked with recreating AirBnB in a tech-stack of our choice. Never backing down from a challenge, we took our *extensive* one week of knowledge in Javascript and our complete lack of experience in online databases and set out to make something great. | Five days | Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jasmine, Cypress, and Firebase Firestore |  
| [Thermostat](https://github.com/Mschmidt19/ThermostatJS), [Live link](https://mschmidt19.github.io/ThermostatJS/) | During our first week of learning Javascript we had multiple small challenges, culminating in the creation of a mock thermostat application. The idea is simple, use a weather API to receive live information on the current temperature of different areas. With this knowledge, we can set the climate-control of each of our several luxurious homes worldwide in order to match. | Five days total, approximately three working on thermostat itself | Javascript, Jasmine, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Google Drawings for art |

## Skills
#### Clean code and readability
I have a strong belief that all code should be written with future developers in mind. Proper code-styling, consistency in naming conventions, and class extraction all help alleviate the "perfectionist" side of me. I try to make my code easy to understand from any outside perspective. In the case of group projects, this has best been achieved through planning, refactoring, and most of all, ongoing communication.

#### Adaptability
So far my life has taken me on a path that I would not have predicted. Unfortunate circumstances took me away from the career that I loved for some time, it has moved me to many new areas, and still I have remained resilient. I like to think that this has granted me the ability to see change not as an enemy, but as a welcome challenge. In the workplace this can be greatly beneficial, for instance in my latest group project we were getting worried about the state of our project and the amount of time we had remaining. As a group, we decided to communicate and explain to each other what our goals were; what did we want to achieve from this task? As it turned out, I was outnumbered. I was intent on delivering the best product possible where many of my teammates were more content with cutting back on features in order to dive deeper into understanding. It was a bit of an eye-opener, to realize our goals were not aligned, but I took a step back and adapted to my team's perspective. We implemented a self-imposed feature freeze, allowing time to refactor, add more tests, and share knowledge with each other about areas we had not written ourselves. In time this lead to a burst of efficiency and many more features later that week. It was a humbling experience, but I'm glad to have learned that there are always new ways to solve a problem.

#### UI / UX
I am always trying to improve the "look and feel" of my projects. Having a background in graphic design, this is most often portrayed in the front-end of my projects. Front-end, however, is not the only place this is employed. Code-styling, organization, and thoughtful naming can accomplish the same task in the back-end side of a project just as a thoughtful yet concise README can accomplish this for a first-time user. I am an advocate of easy-to-use, sleek, and thoughtful products that are precisely created with the end-user in mind.

## Hobbies and Interests
*Design*  
I have a deep passion for making things look as good as they can. This passion expresses itself throughout a large quantity of mediums, often without me noticing! Firstly, I will always strive to make my websites and web apps not only functional, but also beautiful. My work, however, is not the only place where this is true. I have grown interests in activities such as graphic design, game design, woodworking, cooking, home decorating, and fashion all because of my love for things that look great! (Checkout a graphical version of my old CV, link is at the top of this page!)

*Gaming*    
Growing up around computers was a very easy way to grow fond of and embrace computer gaming as a hobby. To me, video games are the perfect showcase for combining amazing art, high-level problem solving, beautiful sounds and music, and of course, outstanding user experience. Each of these aspects on their own are influenced heavily by design, and to see all of these passions of mine come together in one place is an amazing thing.

*Hiking and Camping*   
Shockingly, sometimes I like to look away from my computer screen! There is no better sight to rest my eyes with than a landscape untouched by all the technology I hold so dear.

*Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence*   
When I worked for Interact.Agency I was lucky enough to attend the Augmented World Expo event I was helping to promote. Though I have very little experience working with any of these, I was enthralled by all the incredible possibilities that these prospects hold. I would love to someday delve into those fields in a project of mine.
